Hello o/

I develop software. Among other things.

I make Minecraft mods, along with a special MC IDE Launcher.
Otherwise, I make random stuff for fun.

Kotlin is the best programming language ever and you cannot tell me otherwise. \
I strongly dislike any programming language that overuses arrow brackets <>. Who decided this was a good idea? \
Otherwise I don't mind using Java, JS or Elixir from time to time.

I also do pixel art, mainly for MC textures.

Other than that I am generally friendly and talkative. \
Feel free to hang out in my [discord server](https://discord.gg/26Xd7cE7Ww), we can talk about my projects or other random things.
